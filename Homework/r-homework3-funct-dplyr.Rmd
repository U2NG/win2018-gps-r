```

## Due 1/29 - By Midnight 


### How to submit your homework:
1. Download the [r-homework3.R](r-homework3.R) script and open in Rstudio
2. Rename `r-homework3-funct-dplyr.Rmd` to `yourlastname_sudentID_r-homework3.R`
3. Type the answers in the code chunks. 
4. Save the Rmarkdown file.
5. Upload the file to TritonEd for Assignment 3.  

## load packages and assign gapminder data before you start the assignment:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# load packages dplry, tidyr, ggplot2
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
# assign gapminder data
gapminder <- read.csv('gapminder-FiveYearData.csv') #use your file path
```

## Questions: 

##### 1. Write a function called `weighted_mean` that takes a `gapminder` data.frame as an argument and calculates a trimmed or weighted mean of life expectancy by weighing by population.  To do this you will assign the output of a function that calculates the the sum of `lifeExp` times `pop` divided by the `sum of pop` to a `weighted_mean` object.  Hint: Look up the `?sum` function. 

```{r 1-example}
weighted_mean <- function(gapminder) {
  # 1. complete your weighted mean formula here:
  weighted_mean = sum(  )
  # 2. complete return
  return()
}

```


##### 2. Use dplyr to filter only rows with the continent of Africa.
```{r eval=FALSE}
# 1. compelte your code here:
gapminder %>% 
  filter( ) %>% 
  
# 2. verify filter using the head()
 


```


##### 3. Using the filtered `gapminder` data from the last question (only 'Africa' rows), with your `weighted_mean` function in question 1, what is the weighted mean of life expectancy of Africa? 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# 1. complete the code here (don't forget %>% )
gapminder_ afr <- 
  filter() 
  weighted_mean()


```


##### 4. Create a `dplyr` piped sequence that: 
    * Takes gapminder data and uses `group_by` to group by continent
    * Creates a mean variable that conatins the mean of `lifeExp`
    * Creates a `weighted_mean` variable that takes the sum of lifeExp times pop and divides that by the sum of pop -- the same formula you used in question 1 above. 
    * Print out the resulting dataframe as `weight_mean_dp`
    * The resulting data.frame should look like the below. 

Note: You'll need to use the `summarize` function that `dplyr` gives you. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# 1. write your code here:
weighted_mean_dp <- gapminder %>%
  summarize(
    
  )

# 2. display output



```



##### 5. Using the built in `iris` dataset, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot2`, write a script that creates a plot comparing the petal and sepal widths and lengths values for each species of flower. 

Hint: Start by using tidyr `gather()` function to create a `flowers_df` data frame gathering `Sepal.Length`, `Sepal.Width`, `Petal.Length`, and `Petal.Width` into the key values with `variable` being the ID variable and `value` being the measures. Hint: To express variables you want to `gather` you can use a function like `startsWith()` or use the exclusion operator `-` to tell gather that you want to include everthing but the excluded (e.g `-Species`).

Next use `dplyr` and `ggplot` to create a bar plot comparing the species and values with the geom properties `stat = "identity"` and `position = "dodge"`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# complete code here:
flowers_df <- gather()
flowers_df %>% 
  ggplot() 



```
