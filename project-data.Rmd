Goal: To start utilizing RStudio's project managment feature and use more reproducible approaches to data analysis. 


## Create New Poroject in RStudio

1. Open RStudio and go to `File>New Project` in the top menu
2. Select `New Directory`
3. Choose `Empty Project`
4. Type Directory Name, e.g., gps-r or what you want, and navigate where you want this to live (Desktop is usually easy to find)
5. Select `Create project` and now download the data

## Download gapminder data into the project

We need a data folder inside our project. 

1. Once you create a project above you should be in the project folder and the following will work 
2. In RStudio far lower right pane, select `Files` 
2. Click `New Folder` and name `data`
3. In the console, paste and enter (without the >):

```{r eval=F}
download.file('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resbaz/r-novice-gapminder-files/master/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv', 'data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv')
```

4. This will download and place a gapminderFiveYearData.csv inside the data folder. Browse to the data/ folder to confirm that it worked.  
5. If you are having trouble downloading the data this way, you can [download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resbaz/r-novice-gapminder-files/master/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv) it directly and manually move to the data folder. 

## Instructions with Screenshots (pardon the blur)

1. Open RStudio and go to `File>New Project>New Project` in the top menu  

![Create New project](assets/file-newproject.png "Create new project")

2. Select `New Directory > Empty Project`:  

[![Name New project](assets/create-new-project-dir.png "Create new project dir")](assets/create-proj-name-dir.png)

3. Create a new data folder in project folder:

4. Download gapminder data into data folder: 

From console, run:

```{r eval=FALSE}
download.file('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resbaz/r-novice-gapminder-files/master/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv', 'data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv')
```
